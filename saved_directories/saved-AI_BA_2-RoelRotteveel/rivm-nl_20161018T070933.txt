The Netherlands has an extensive National Immunisation Programme to protect children against infectious diseases. The programme includes vaccination against 12 potentially fatal infectious diseases.

To ensure that children receive maximum protection against these diseases, vaccinations are given in four steps. As from august 2011 all babies receive also vaccination against hepatitis B. Infants whose mothers are hepatitis B carriers also receive hepatitis B vaccination within 48 hours of birth. 
 It is essential that children complete the vaccination cycle as scheduled. If your child has not been vaccinated as scheduled, you need to seek medical advice to ensure that your child receives adequate protection.

The Immunisation Programme is free of charge. While participation is not compulsory, over 95% of parents consent to having their children vaccinated. The high vaccination rate means that these serious diseases have now become a rarity. We need to keep it that way by ensuring that children are vaccinated.
