## How to run?

- The code in this project is formatted as an .ipynb (notebook file). This can be run via Jupyter, Google Colab or other notebook editors. We developed the code in collab, thus we used the fourth cell for uploading the files to collab. However, when this code is run in Jupyter or another similar notebook editor the third cell can be used for loading the data (NOTE that the data has to be located in the same folder as the notebook, this is automatically true when cloning our repository from GitHub)
